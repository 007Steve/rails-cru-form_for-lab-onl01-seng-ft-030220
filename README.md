# CRU with form_for Lab

## Objectives

1. Build RESTful actions for index, show, new, create, edit, update
2. Use form_for for all forms (no need to share forms or partials)
3. Correctly redirect when needed (...)
4. Interlink between pages using route helpers 

## Notes

build index,show,new,create,edit,update for Song, Artist, and Genre.
Do not use the scaffold generator but feel free to use any other
all of them just have a single property, name (hmm, maybe we can figure out more fields to add?)
we've given no code.

Interlink between pages using route helpers (show should link to edit, index should link to new and show).
